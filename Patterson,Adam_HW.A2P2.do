* Question 1
* Adam Patterson

* a) The predicted increase in earnings from a one year increase in schooling is 1958 dollars and 71 cents. 

* b) The standard error of the education estimate is 96 dollars and 27 cents. 

* c) The R2 is .1453 while the adjusted R2 (more approrpiate given the 2 independent variables) is .1446

* d) The estimate of the regression line intercept is -9762.29. In our case, this is acceptable as it is very improbable that an individual is in the labor force with 0 years of education. 

* e) This regression model uses 2490 observations for estimation. 

* f) The standard deviation of the 100 estimates should asymptotically approach 0 as n converges to the true population N.  I ran many simulations in R playing around with various sample sizes, without replacement, assuming a dataset to be the true population. Even using a sample of 1,000 out of 200,000 observations (a small percent), the std was 0.14 which was still close to 0. Conversely, using N - 1 resuled in a scientific notation value very very close to 0. Essentially 0.
