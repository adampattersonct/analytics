** HW A2P1
** Question 2

* a) I would randomly split a heterogenous sample of at least 30 students into a treatment and control. I would give the treatment group 40 hours of the SAT preparation course while I gave the control group an "SAT preparation course" which covers no material related to the SAT. I would give the fake class to the control just to account for potential psychological effects of having completed an "SAT preparation course". We could then create a dummy variable for students in treatment and run a regression to estimate the effects of the prep class. In theory, if our sample is large enough, the randomization should approximately cancel out the influence of covariates in both treatmeant and control groups. 

* b) Example factors contained in the unobservables are intelligence (ability), parents' income or marital status, and high school GPA to name just a few. I would anticipate all three variables to be positively correlated with sat performance. Some negative unobservable factors could include alcohol or smoking use. As a student uses more alcohol, they may be less likely to perform at a high academic level. 

* c) The sign of Beta 1, the estimate for hours spent in an sat preparation course, should be positive if the class is effective. For each additional one hour spent in the class, the sat score should be increased. 

* d) The intercept value interpreation is the sat score for students in the sample when hours spent in the prep class is 0. This would include students without having any sat preparation courses.
