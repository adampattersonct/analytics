This repository serves as a miscellaneous board of different projects. You will find some basic data analysis as a technical report for my supervisor.
You will also find codes from projects that I was asked to support my resarch team. You will also find rough copies of code that are not well documented with hastags. 
These pieces are just meant to showcase the breadth of what I have performed.


The python codes were part of a PhD level econometrics class in which STATA was the source of instruction. Our classmates had to check our work as part of homework assignments, thus I had to submit work in STATA. I researched how to embed Python into STATA. This is hard to do on MAC so I bought a Microsoft for the class. I wish to develop better Python skills as I can really see the total net benefit. I also learned that STATA does not like Python visualization packages. Given my research contract and the other PhD classes I had to complete, I could not time efficiently figure out how to get the wald test running in one of the homeworks. As I researched these codes and techniques myself, it often took me a little longer than I had planned to complete these homeworks.
