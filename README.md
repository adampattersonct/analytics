# analytics

This repository serves as a miscellaneous board of different projects. You will find some basic data analysis embedded as a technical report for my supervisor.
You will also find codes from projects that I was asked to support my resarch team. You will also find rough copies of code that are not well documented with hastags. 
These pieces are just meant to showcase the breadth of what I have performed.
